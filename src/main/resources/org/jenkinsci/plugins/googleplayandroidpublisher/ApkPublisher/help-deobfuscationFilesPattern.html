<div>
  Specifies filenames or patterns matching one or more ProGuard or Native code mapping
  files that should be uploaded to Google Play, so that it can automatically
  deobfuscate stacktraces from crash reports.
  <p/>
  You can use wildcards like "<tt>**/build/**/mapping.txt</tt>".<br/>
  You can use wildcards like "<tt>**/build/**/symbols.zip</tt>".<br/>
  See <a href='https://ant.apache.org/manual/Types/fileset.html'>
  the 'includes' attribute of Ant's FileSet</a> for the exact format.<br/>
  Note that multiple entries must be comma-separated.
  <p/>
  The base directory is <a href='ws/'>the build's workspace</a>.
  You can only upload mapping files that are located in your workspace.
  <p/>
  If there are multiple files being uploaded, and only one
  <tt>mapping.txt</tt> file is found, then this file will be associated
  with each of the files being uploaded. If there are multiple
  <tt>mapping.txt</tt> files, this plugin will make a basic attempt to
  associate each mapping file with the corresponding AAB/APK file.<br/>
  Otherwise, if the number of mapping files found is not equal to the
  number of APKs being uploaded, the build will fail, as this situation
  is not supported.
  <p/>

  Google Play documentation:<br/>

  This field supports substituting environment variables in the form
  <tt>${SOME_VARIABLE}</tt> or <tt>$SOME_VARIABLE</tt> at build time.
